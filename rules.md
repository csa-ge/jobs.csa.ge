# What's up?

We are connecting good tech employers with good tech employees. We are in the
headhunting and recruitment business, but only in tech. We're different 
because we have very **high standards** both for employers and employees.

# Are you profiting from this?

We are doing this to help people and also to keep the the lights on. Our commission is
**25%** of the **first salary**. Any parties who will not follow this rule will be banned
from the community (both employers and employees). We enforce this by **trusting** people.
Don't abuse our trust. We live in a small country, everybody knows everybody, consequences
will be **dire**.

To make things perfectly clear, that commission is paid by a hiring company, not by an employee.
We are only operating within Georgian borders and companies that have operations in Georgia,
we have **no business** with companies who have no presence in Georgia. 

# What are the requirements for employees?

We only consider candidates who have very well written resumes and an excellent LinkedIn profiles.
We expect our candidates to be good at negotiations, because, as always, practice makes perfect.

We expect everybody to have a reasonable computer science background. We don't expect you to know
how a red black tree is implemented, but you should know the difference between a tree and a hash. You
should know all the basic data structures (lists, sets, maps, queues, stacks...) and also some
basic algorithms: graph traversals, recursion, searching, sorting, string manipulation...

We expect everybody to have a reasonable engineering experience. We are not interested in people who
have only written pseudocode or who know that a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors.
Those people are cool as well, we have nothing against them, but we think job market demands people
with actual real world coding experience. We expect you to know the basics of logging, monitoring, build tools,
certain frameworks or toolchains.

Knowing the right tools makes you super efficient. We don't care weather you like `vim` or `emacs`,
you enjoy `IntelliJ` or prefer `Sublime`, but we want you to know at least one of IDEs/editors quite well.
`git` is something used by every programmer, so that's also a must know. Knowing good command line tools, 
weird unix command like `sed` or `awk` are hard to learn, but they have enormous ROI.

Communication skills are a must have. Coding is not communicating with computer, it's communicating
with other engineers. If a person is a good communicator (like Ronald Reagan) code quality is very
high in most cases. Code is written to be read more frequently than edited. That's why `vim` has reading
mode and writing mode (and that's why it is so good for generating random numbers).

Programming is a very recent profession. Although things used change much faster back then and pace of
change is only going to slow down, we expect everyone to be fast learners. You might be writing in Java
one day and have to move to C# another day. That kind of change should be very natural. Those two languages
and their ecosystems are very much alike because of huge cross pollination.

# What are the requirements for employers?

You need to be a **good** employer, that's a rule of thumb. We also have a minimum salary guideline of
**3K**. When we talk about salaries, we always mean GEL and we always mean net salary, the one you get in 
your bank account every month. Expect minimum guideline to increase as time goes by.

Also, we expect our candidate companies to have a very good company culture. We embrace diversity and we
like the kind of work environment where talent is appreciated and people are valued accordingly.

Always remember, to us salary is only part of the equation. Everybody knows at least one guy who went for
a much smaller salary just because he liked the project.

Most tech companies have 3 ways to financially support employers: salary, bonus and equity. We expect same
thing here.

There are many other important factors: signing bonus, flexibility of a contract, working hours, boss, 
career perspectives, working conditions (some people love remote work), food, transportation, travel,
insurance, pension, technologies.

We *hate* dress code. We believe most engineers are meant to have very thick beards, have hipster glasses
and wear green shorts with red sandals. If your company requires a dress code, we might still give you a chance,
but to our candidates it is a very big **red flag**.

# Can you help me with my resume?

Sure, we are more than willing to help. Check out our examples at [jobs.csa.ge/resumes](http://jobs.csa.ge/resumes) 
and feel free to use any of them as your template.

We exclusively use LaTeX. We recommend using [ShareLaTeX](https://sharelatex.com)
([Good Blueprint](https://github.com/zmanji/zameermanji.com/blob/master/content/resume.tex)).
Always send both PDF and TEX formats. If you are interested in dos and don'ts look at other resumes.
If nobody is entering gender or age, you should not probably enter it as well.

Every admin knows how to properly write a resume and they will probably give you useful feedback if
you submit for a review.

# Is English the only language?

We will never consider employers or employees who do not know any English at all.
We strongly believe every person in tech should know good English and therefore
it is our only communication language.

If your English skills are not that great and you wish to improve, don't be afraid of
using bad English. We will help you as much as we can. Try to ask friends for help before
posting. There are tons of good resources online. Just don't write anything in Georgian,
it will get deleted with no questions asked.

# I have a PR about the rules, can I submit it?

You can always give it a try, if you see a typo, or you think rewording certain things would make sense,
we would really appreciate your PR. We don't make any promises, especially when changes are controversial.

# I what to refer somebody, what can I do?

If you want to refer someone (either a potential employer or a potential employee) who you think meets our criteria,
get in touch will any of the admins, we will gladly consider them, but we don't make any promises.

# Do you have any information privacy rules?

As a rule of thumb, we share almost all information publicly. We believe openness is a very good thing.

So be advised, if you have some kind of information you are not willing to share publicly, please make
it very clear and very explicit with our admins.

# I'm an admin of the community, what should I enforce?

1. Don't forget, we are in the business of helping people, be nice and helpful.
2. Add good people (if there is anything questionable, ask other admins).
3. Delete any non-English data (no warnings).
4. Review people's resumes and give useful feedback.
5. Combat spam.
6. Don't write anything foolish, remove bad content.
7. Don't approve anybody you don't personally know. If you know a guy who knows a guy and you trust that guy, use your better judgement.
8. share [jobs.csa.ge](jobs.csa.ge) to all interested parties.
9. Push employers and employees to become better.
10. Don't trust anybody other than our own. If in doubt, ask others.
